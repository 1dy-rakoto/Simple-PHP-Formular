# Simple PHP Formular

This repository contains a simple PHP formular that demonstrates the usage of PHP for form processing and validation. The formular allows users to submit data, which is then processed and validated using PHP server-side scripting.

## Features
- **Form Input**: Provides input fields for users to enter data (such as name, email, and message).
- **Form Validation**: Implements basic validation on the form inputs, checking for required fields and validating the email format.
- **Data Processing**: Demonstrates how to handle and process the form data using PHP server-side scripting.
- **Feedback and Confirmation**: Provides feedback to the user, confirming the successful submission of the form or displaying error messages if validation fails.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository using the following command:
2. Set up a local development environment with a PHP-enabled web server (e.g., Apache).

3. Open the PHP file containing the form in a text editor and customize it according to your specific form requirements.
- Update the form fields, labels, and validation rules as needed.
- Modify the PHP code to handle the form submission and validation logic.

4. Save the file and place it in the appropriate directory of your local web server.

5. Start the local web server and open the form in a web browser.

6. Fill in the form fields and submit the form to see the data processing and validation in action.
